Python is an interpreted high-level programming language that emphasizes code readability with its significant indentation.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected, and it has a large and comprehensive standard library.
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web development.

Thanks to its simple syntax and vast ecosystem of third-party libraries, Python has become the language of choice for scientists, data analysts, and educators.
Its flexibility allows developers to create small scripts or large applications with equal ease.
Over the last decade, Python has gained prominence as a leader in machine learning frameworks, competing with and complementing other languages in the programming world.
